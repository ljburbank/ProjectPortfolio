This project showcases parellel programming being put into play using CUDA and a graphics card.

The purpose of the program is to first generate points on a 2d plane, and then calculate how many of those points are within a certain given distance of each other

The program must be run in an environment with CUDA access, with it initially being run on a supercomputer server accessible to my university.
