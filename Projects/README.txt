Each folder here is a different one of the major projects I worked on throughout my time at university. More information on each project is available within each folder's
README, and I will list out a summary of each below.




The Application Server is primarily focused on showcasing a distributed system in execution. Ultimately, it uses networking to bounce requests between multiple servers
to handle the request appropriately and with specific roles for each server.


The Distributed Chat Application is similar to the Application Server, except that it instead is built to showcase a peer to peer network being put in place. Each
user that connects to one of these networks will then be able to chat with all others who have joined, and it handles different types of exit and join situations.


The Engineering Career Network is my biggest project throughout my time at university, and it was my Capstone project throughout my Senior year. It was worked on in a team,
and I was the team lead. The project showcases my web development skills, in both frontend and backend programming. I took the lead as well on integrating the different
parts, giving me some valuable experience in full stack development. Being the lead also helped me learn and see how to break different responsibilites and functions up
to allow for smaller, workable parts by the team members.


The Operating System Simulation is my second biggest project, with it taking around a full semester to complete. The primary focus of this project was to understand and
implement an operating system and how it functions at its core. The project also included threading the different operations being done, allowing for the operations to be
simultaneously executed. It also handles scheduling methods for the op codes being passed in.


The Parallel Distance Calculator is the final project being shown, and it is mainly focuesd on generating a given number of points (coded to 100,000 by default), and finding
how many of those points are within a given distance of one another (distance passed in as parameter). The project showcases multithreading being done using a graphics card
and CUDA while connected to a computing cluster.




Overall, I have chosen these projects to showcase as they are the fullest and biggest projects I have worked on while at NAU. They also help display the different concepts
and fields I have worked with, such as multithreading, web development, distributed systems, and networking. While these are not the only projects and concepts I have worked
on, they are the fields in which my understanding and knowledge is strongest.
