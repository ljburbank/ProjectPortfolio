This project showcases a peer to peer application being put into place. Each user that runs the application can connect to one another, and joining someone with other
connections will merge them all into one, allowing for a group chat application.

Each client must know the target client's IP address, as well as the port being listened on. The non-hardcoded port allows for multiple connections to be made at one time.
