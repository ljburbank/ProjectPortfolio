This project is my primary one throughout my college experience, with it being my Capstone.

I worked on the project with 4 other students, and I was the lead on the project throughout the year. We have set up a website that holds our different documents
and information obtained throughout the year.

The website is internal to NAU, and is currently up at https://ac.nau.edu/egrcn as included in the other text file.

The full backend and frontend were developed by our team using Node.js, and the database being used is a Microsoft SQL Database server on NAU's campus.

*The site uses its own account system, though it is meant for NAU students only, so it may not be accessible from the given URL outside of the sign in and register page.

**I have included screenshots of the different pages on the site in an extra folder as the pages may not be able to be seen due to the problem mentioned just previously.



WHAT THE WEBSITE DOES

The primary purpose of the website it to collect and track information regarding student careers. This is done by using a web scraping tool that will pull career experience
from a student's LinkedIn account, and then display it on our site on their profile. It will only pull publicly available data, and will only do so after the student has
submitted their LinkedIn URL and agreed to have the experiences scraped.

An administrator, as well as the students, can then see a dashboard showing the overall progress of the students within different fields and regarding different types of
career milestones. This dashboard will pull directly from the website's database, and the data displayed will be based off of how many students have those experiences either
on their LinkedIn, or manually input on their page within our site, giving the students some active functionality.

Adminsistrators also have the ability to add new programs (majors), as well as the ability to verify the milestones being inserted into the system by web scraping, to ensure
there is some human verification being done for each milestone added.
